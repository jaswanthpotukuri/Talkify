# Talkify
This project develops a voice recognition system that converts spoken words into text in real-time, providing deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals with access to spoken information.
By translating speech into readable text, it helps bridge communication gaps, allowing deaf users to better engage in conversations and everyday situations, promoting inclusion and independence.
